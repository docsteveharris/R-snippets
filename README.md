R-snippets
==========

This package includes a selection of R snippets for Sublimetext that I find useful when using R through SublimeREPL

Just type the trigger and hit the tab key.

Main triggers:
- "aov": gives distinct analysis of variance models
- "edit": gives options useful for data cleansing
- "lm": linear and logistic regression
- "lmem": linear mixed effects models
